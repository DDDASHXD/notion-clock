# Notion clock widget

Date Started: October 8, 2021
Progress: Needs Debugging

## Intro

I'm a big fan of the way iOS looks, and i just discovered Notion, so obviously i needed my first widget to look like the clock from the iOS and ipadOS lock screen.

It's cookie based, meaning that you can change between light and dark mode, and change the color of the main clock(Find settings by hovering over the clock), and notion will remember the settings in the future.

This however does mean that when changing to a different device, you will have to change the settings again for that device, but it won't change on other devices.

### How to add widget

1. Go to any notion page
2. type /embed
3. Enter the link `[dddashxd.github.io/notion-clock](http://dddashxd.github.io/notion-clock)`
4. Hit embed, and boom! bob's your uncle.

### Multiple pages? No problem!

If you wan't to add the clock to more pages, that have different themes, i've created multiple instances of the clock.

You just simply enter `[dddashxd.github.io/notion-clock/two](http://dddashxd.github.io/notion-clock/two)` or `/three` (More might be added in the future) into the embed link box.
